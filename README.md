timetape.vim
============

A precise time tracker for Vim. 

Timetape does everything for you automatically. You don't have to waste your
precious time managing worked hours or whatever. This plugin tracks the period
of time from the moment you enter in the insert mode.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and the simply copy and
paste:

    git clone git://github.com/rainerborene/timetape ~/.vim/bundle/timetape
