timetape.vim
============

A precise time tracker for Vim. 

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and the simply copy and
paste:

    git clone git://github.com/rainerborene/timetape.git ~/.vim/bundle/timetape
